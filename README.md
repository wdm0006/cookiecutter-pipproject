- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: Ultra-fast Python package installer and resolver
- Automatic version management
- Development and production dependency separation
- Proper package metadata and classifiers

### üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
- **[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)**: Modern testing framework
- **[tox](https://tox.wiki/)**: Automated testing across Python versions
- **[Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)**: Code coverage tracking
- Configured for both unit and integration tests
- Test fixtures and helpers included

### üìù Code Quality Tools
- **[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)**: Ultra-fast Python linter and formatter

  - Testing across Python versions
  - Code quality checks
  - Documentation builds
  - Automated PyPI releases
  - Security scanning
- **Codecov** integration for coverage reporting
- Automated dependency updates

### ü§ù Community & Contribution Tools
- Structured issue templates for:
  - Bug reports
  - Feature requests
  - Documentation improvements
- Pull request template
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Security policy
- Support resources

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow
- **Makefile** with common development commands:
  ```bash
  make install-dev    # Install development dependencies
  make test          # Run tests
  make lint          # Check code quality
  make format        # Format code
  make docs          # Build documentation
  make clean         # Clean build artifacts
  ```
- **pre-commit** hooks for code quality
- VS Code/PyCharm configurations
- Debug configurations

## Quick Start

1. Install Cookiecutter:
   ```bash
   pip install cookiecutter
   ```

2. Create your project:
   ```bash
   cookiecutter gh:{{cookiecutter.github_username}}/cookiecutter-pipproject
   ```

3. Initialize your development environment:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Install uv
   make install-dev
   ```

4. Start developing:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   make test

   # Check code quality
   make lint

   # Format code
   make format

   # Build docs
   make docs
   ```

## Why These Tools?

### Modern Packaging (pyproject.toml + hatch + uv)
- **Why**: Traditional `setup.py` is being phased out in favor of declarative configuration
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cleaner, more maintainable package configuration
  - Faster, more reliable dependency resolution
  - Better reproducibility
  - Improved build isolation

### Code Quality (ruff + mypy)
- **Why**: Python's dynamic nature requires strong tooling to catch issues early
- **Benefits**:
  - Catch bugs before they reach production
  - Maintain consistent code style
  - Improve code maintainability
  - Speed up code reviews
  - Ultra-fast performance (Rust-based tools)

### Testing (pytest + tox)
- **Why**: Comprehensive testing across environments is crucial for libraries
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensure compatibility across Python versions
  - Isolate tests from system dependencies
  - Parallel test execution
  - Rich plugin ecosystem

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **Why**: Automation is key to maintaining quality and velocity
- **Benefits**:
  - Catch issues early
  - Ensure quality on every change
  - Automate releases
  - Reduce manual work
  - Build trust with users

### Documentation (Sphinx)
- **Why**: Good documentation is crucial for library adoption
- **Benefits**:
  - Professional-looking documentation
  - API documentation from docstrings
  - Versioned documentation
  - Search functionality
  - Multiple output formats
